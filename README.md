# Denoise Images
The primary objective of the project was to develop a method for denoising noisy images, specifically focusing on the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset contains handwritten digits, which are widely used for training and testing image processing systems, particularly in the context of machine learning and neural networks. The goals included:

Understanding the Impact of Noise on Image Quality: By adding noise to the original MNIST images, the project aimed to simulate real-world conditions where images might be corrupted by various types of noise.
Developing a Denoising Algorithm: The key objective was to create an algorithm, likely using neural networks such as autoencoders, that could effectively remove noise from the images while preserving the essential features required for tasks like digit recognition.
Evaluating Denoising Performance: The project aimed to visually and quantitatively assess the performance of the denoising algorithm by comparing the original, noisy, and denoised images.
Achievements
The project successfully demonstrated the following:

Visualization of Noisy and Denoised Images: By plotting the original, noisy, and denoised images side by side, the project effectively showcased the impact of the denoising algorithm. The provided code is used to display these images in a clear and organized manner.

Original Images: Displayed in the first row, showing the unaltered MNIST digits.
Noisy Images: Displayed in the second row, demonstrating how the original images were corrupted with noise.
Denoised Images: Displayed in the third row, showing the output of the denoising algorithm, which aims to restore the original appearance of the images.
Implementation of a Denoising Technique: The code suggests that a neural network-based approach (likely an autoencoder) was implemented to learn the mapping from noisy images to clean images. This involves training a model on a dataset of paired noisy and clean images.

Qualitative Assessment: By visually inspecting the denoised images, it is possible to qualitatively assess how well the algorithm performs in terms of removing noise while preserving the digit shapes.
